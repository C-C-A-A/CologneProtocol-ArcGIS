- An ArcGIS Toolbox for an automated export of LEC Contour lines to polygons (ArcGIS < 10.6)


### Overview:

The **Cologne Protocol** is a geostatistical approach for estimating prehistoric population size and density.  
This repository contains a manual on how to model Core Areas with `ArcGIS 10.X`. This modelling approach constitutes the first of two successive tasks within the **Cologne Protocol** to estimate past population sizes and densities, described in more detail elsewhere (Schmidt et al. 2020: S2.1. and S2.2.).

`CGN_Protocol_ArcGIS_Manual.pdf` outlines the technical implementation of working steps 1 to 11 (see *Schmidt et al. 2020: Table S2*).  Please read the publication and supplement (*Schmidt et al.Â 2020*) beforehand. Writing an ArcGIS toolbox for the entire process has been avoided since setting up the kriging parameters should be done via visual inspection. the best option for this is using the `Geostatistical Wizard` in case you have the extension `Geostatistical Analyist` installed and running. 

### How to use

- Please read the publication and supplement (*Schmidt et al. 2020*) first and then to start with the example application described in  `CGN_Protocol_ArcGIS_Manual.pdf`.

### Other resources

Other manuals and resources  exist to run the first two parts of the **Cologne Protocol**. The above mentioned publications is not only accompanied by an `ArcGIS` manual but also by manuals for `QGIS`, `MapInfo` and `R`. Please see the publication for more information.
